# WeRateDogs-data
## Project description
  The dataset represented in this project is the tweet archive of Twitter 
user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
  WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous 
comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
The numerators always greater than 10: 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? 
Because "they are good dogs Brent."

## Required Python libraries

 - padas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - requests
 - tweepy (working with Twitter API)
 - tqdm (progess bar)
 - JSON
 - os
 - PIL
 - wordcloud (text visualization)
 - re (regular expressions)
 
 ## Project goals
 - Gather
 - Clean
 - Anylize
 - Visualize
 
 Using Python libraries and Twitter API collect necessary data and extract useful information.
